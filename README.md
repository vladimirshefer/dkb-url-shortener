# URL Shortener

## The task
Imagine you're building an URL shortener as a potential next-big-thing product. To
test it, we would like to first have an MVP with only basic functionality.

However, if everything goes according to plan, we will invest more effort into
this so even the MVP should be a modern, nicely written, maintainable and
production ready API.

For the MVP we don't want any kind of user registration or security. We only care
that we provide a proper REST API that will enable other users/ clients to send a
URL and will receive some kind of identifier/ hash to which this URL corresponds
in our system. And the other way around of course, meaning that a user should be
able to resolve the full URL.

To speed up the development, we won't be writing everything on our own, so please
think of libraries/ components you could use to fulfill the task.

### Helpful info:
- include .git folder in your solution so we can, with the help of the Git
  history, see and understand your thinking process
- production ready API can mean a lot of things to different people. We're
  interested to see what you think a quality production ready API solution looks
  like. Imagine that the moment you deliver the solution, we'll deploy it to all our
  environments, consisting of multiple instances. So, provide data in a way that
  allows customization for dedicated environments
- when designing the solution please think about global scalability: what
  endpoints will be used the most, what might be a bottle neck, what could be a
  possible solution to identify problems
  Have fun with our coding challenge. If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to
  ask.
